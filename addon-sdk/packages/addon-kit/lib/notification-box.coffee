  # relates to. We could search for tabs with that index, but that's

  # sending the callback and opening the notification, we might open the
  # notification on the wrong tab.

  # So this takes the very simple approach of just checking the url of every
  # tab, and opening a notification if it uses the right url. Of course, we
  # should only do that once because the user might have closed it.
