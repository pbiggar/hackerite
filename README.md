For every web page that you open, see if the page has been discussed on Hacker
News. If it has, open a toolbar showing its HN submission title, the number of
points it got, when it was posted, and the number of comments. Also link to the
comments.

Note:
  If building the xpi yourself, you need to use the Jetpack SDK including in
  the repo. It's been hacked up to add access to the notification box.

TODO:
  In the future, this should also let you log in to HN, and up- and down-vote
  posts.
